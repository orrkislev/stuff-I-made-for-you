  <subtitle>What is this?</subtitle>
  <content>
    <p>This creative coding sketch generates abstract images of interconnected nodes. 
       It creates a network of points (nodes) and draws connections between them, resulting in organic, flowing shapes.</p>

  <title>How It Works</title>

  <content>
    <ul>
      <li>The sketch starts with a single node and builds a network by adding connected nodes.</li>
      <li>It then applies various visual effects like gradients, different node sizes, and "holes" to create interesting patterns.</li>
      <li>The final image is composed of these connected nodes with varying styles and colors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Playing with parameters:
       You can adjust several parameters to change the output:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Colors: Change the color palette used</li>
      <li>Network length: Alter the number of nodes in the network</li>
      <li>Node size and variety: Modify the size and variation of individual nodes</li>
      <li>Connection style: Adjust how nodes connect (e.g., full or fancy connections)</li>
      <li>Grid type: Switch between linear and hexagonal layouts</li>
      <li>Randomness: Tweak settings like hole chance and random seed for different results</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Experiment with these parameters to create unique abstract compositions each time you run the sketch.</p>
