    <p>
      This is an interactive creative coding sketch that generates 3D-like visualizations of cylindrical structures.
      As you drag your mouse, it creates colorful, organic-looking cylinders that rotate and undulate, giving the
      impression of woven or braided tubes.

  <title>How It Works</title>

  <content>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Mouse input creates "bodies" composed of circular rings</li>
      <li>2. Rings are made of nodes arranged in a circular pattern</li>
      <li>3. Perlin noise influences node positions, creating organic shapes and gaps</li>
      <li>4. The structure rotates and animates with subtle undulation</li>
      <li>5. Simple 3D-to-2D projection is used for rendering</li>
      <li>6. Lines are drawn between nodes to form the cylindrical shape</li>
      <li>7. Sections are sorted by depth for a basic 3D effect</li>
      <li>8. Darker colors are applied to parts that appear to be "behind" others</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The result is a visually engaging, semi-3D effect that produces organic-looking cylindrical structures through
      user interaction.
