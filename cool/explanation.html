    <title>What is it</title>
    <content>
        an interactive digital piece that distorts text based on mouse movement. It starts with an ampersand (&) symbol
        on screen.
        The displayed character's pixels shift and blur in response to your cursor's position. You can change the
        character by pressing any key.

    <title>How to interact and how it works</title>
    <content>
        Move your mouse over the canvas to distort the character.
        Press any key to display a different character.
        The script uses these main elements:

        <ul>
            <li>An offscreen graphics buffer holds the text.</li>
            <li>Each frame, it selects random points near the mouse cursor.</li>
            <li>Points close to the mouse are rotated, with the effect decreasing farther from the cursor.</li>
            <li>It samples colors from the offscreen graphics and applies them to the main canvas.</li>
            <li>This process repeats quickly to create smooth movement.</li>
        </ul>

        The result is an interactive piece where text responds to your mouse movements, creating a fluid, distorted
        effect.
