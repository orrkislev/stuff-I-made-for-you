    <title>how does it work?</title>
    <content>
        <p>each friend is a circle with eyes, and they are being pushed around by more circles, calculated by the
            matter.js physics engine, and drawn using p5js circle() function</p>
        <p>as the canvas does not clear itself, the friends leave a trail behind them, making them look snake-like</p>
