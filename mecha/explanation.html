    <content>
        <ul>
        <li>The sketch sets up a 3D scene with a floor and lighting.</li>
        <li>It generates a number of boxes and bubbles with random properties.</li>
        <li>Each box is mirrored across the vertical axis for symmetry.</li>
        <li>An animation loop continuously updates and renders the scene.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The sketch includes orbit controls, allowing users to interact with the 3D view. By adjusting the main parameters, users can customize the appearance and complexity of the mech speeder structure.</p>
