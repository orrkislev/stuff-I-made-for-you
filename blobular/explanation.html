    <p>
      Blobular Flow is a creative coding sketch that simulates the behavior of particle systems, visualizing them as organic, blob-like entities. The sketch features two families of particles, represented by pink and white blobs, that interact with each other and their environment in a fluid, dynamic manner.

      <div><strong>Mouse Movement:</strong> Move your cursor around the sketch. Particles will be repelled from your mouse, creating dynamic interactions with the blobs.</div>
      <div><strong>Edges:</strong> Observe how particles bounce off the edges of the canvas, maintaining a border around the sketch.</div>

  <subtitle>How it works?</subtitle>
  <content>
    <div><strong>Particle System:</strong> The core of the sketch is a particle system where each dot is an instance of the Dot class.</div>
    <div><strong>Spatial Indexing:</strong> A KD-Bush spatial index is used for efficient neighbor lookups.</div>
    <div><strong>Forces:</strong> Particles are subject to various forces:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>- Attraction/repulsion between particles</li>
      <li>- Repulsion from the mouse cursor</li>
      <li>- A slight rotational force towards the center</li>
    </ul>
    <div><strong>Visualization:</strong> Particles are rendered as circles, then processed with blur and threshold filters to create the blob effect.</div>

  <subtitle>Main Parameters</subtitle>
  <content>
    <ul>
      <li>blobSize (default: 8): Controls the size of individual particles before blurring.</li>
      <li>blurSize (default: 6): Determines the amount of blur applied to the particle rendering.</li>
      <li>threshold (default: 0.4): Sets the cutoff point for the threshold filter, affecting blob shape and size.</li>
      <li>border (default: 250): Defines the invisible boundary from the edge of the canvas.</li>
      <li>backgroundColor (default: '#333'): Sets the background color of the sketch.</li>
      <li>families (default: ['pink', 'white']): Defines the colors of the two particle families.</li>
      <li>dotsPerFamily (default: 100): Sets the number of particles in each family.</li>
  </ul>

    Adjusting these parameters can dramatically change the appearance and behavior of the Blobular Flow, allowing for a wide range of visual effects and interactions.
