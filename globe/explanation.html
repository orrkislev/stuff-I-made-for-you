  <subtitle>What is this?</subtitle>
  <content>
    <p>This code creates an interactive visualization of a growing network. It uses p5.js for graphics and Matter.js for
      physics simulation.</p>
    <p>The code handles drawing, growth logic, and physics interactions. It creates a dynamic, expanding network
      structure
      that responds to user input and evolves over time.</p>

  <title>How It Works</title>

  <content>
    <p>The network consists of circles (vertices) connected by lines. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clicking the mouse adds a new circle at that location.</li>
      <li>Every few frames, the network grows automatically:
        <ul>
          <li>It selects an existing circle</li>
          <li>Creates a new circle nearby</li>
          <li>Connects them with a line</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The network moves dynamically due to simulated physics</li>
      <li>Circles with only one connection are drawn slightly larger</li>
      <li>Pressing the spacebar pauses or resumes the animation</li>
    </ul>
